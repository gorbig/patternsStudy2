Jiraiya-sensei collected various information about Akatsuka, as well as creating his new novel. Naruto was improving as a ninja, delving into the study of ninjutsu and taijutsu. Now they return to the village, to close friends. Things have changed in the village too. Grandma Tsunade's face has been carved into the mountainside, as she was the fifth hokage. All of Naruto's classmates had become excellent shinobi and had long since earned the title of Chunina. Gaara had already become a full-fledged Kazekage and was running a village hidden in the sand.\n" +

                "But despite all this good news, there are still many unsolved mysteries and problems in the world of Naruto. The Akatsuki organization begins to take action. They have some sort of plan and in order to carry it out they need to capture all of the Jinchuriki (a person who contains one of the 9 tailed beasts). Naruto is himself a Jinchuriki, and thus ends up on the list. Sasuke has run away from the village and still hasn't returned. Naruto is determined to get his friend back before Orochimaru takes over his body, but Sasuke has only revenge in mind and is eager to kill his brother. In fact, many new stories, battles and characters await in the sequel to the cult anime Naruto: The Ugly Chronicles (Naruto Shippuuden).");
